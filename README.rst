Excerpt from the article by Chris George

    Outliners impose structure on documents. Sadly, they can also impose structure on our thinking, making creativity a lot harder. Leo is different. Instead of imposing structure, it allows you to impose your own infrastructure, and then be as creative as you want. This brings the necessary chaos of creativity to heel when it is time to produce the document. The node structure creates ultimate flexibility when it comes to ordering scenes in chapter. Say good-bye to copy and paste and hello to drag and drop.

Scripting Leo
=============
The power of Leo is accentuated by its integrated scripting ecosystem using Python and Qt. Each outline becomes a living and breathing document with its own behavior and user interface.
